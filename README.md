# Python Exploratory data analysis. 

There is a cricket IPL dataset from the year 2016 - 2017. I have used the concepts of pandas library to find out the solution of the problems .

About Cricket
Cricket is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of eleven players each on a cricket field, at the center of which is a rectangular 20-meter (22-yard) pitch with a target at each end called the wicket (a set of three wooden stumps upon which two bails sit). Each phase of play is called an innings, during which one team bats, attempting to score as many runs as possible, whilst their opponents bowl and field, attempting to minimize the number of runs scored. When each innings ends, the teams usually swap roles for the next innings (i.e. the team that previously batted will bowl/field, and vice versa). The teams each bat for one or two innings, depending on the type of match. The winning team is the one that scores the most runs, including any extras gained (except when the result is not a win/loss result).

The Data Dictionary

The data set contains Players performances in all teams in the years of 2016-2019 in the IPL Tournament.

Here's an explanation of each feature in your dataset:

1. Team: This column likely represents the name of the cricket team to which the player belongs. It tells you which team the player is associated with.

2. Player: This column contains the name  of the cricket player. It specifies which player's data is being recorded.

3. Tournament: This column likely indicates the name of the cricket tournament or series in which these matches took place. It helps you identify the specific event or competition.

4. Matches: This feature represents the total number of matches that the player has participated in during the specified period. It indicates the player's level of participation in the tournament.

5. Batting Innings: This column indicates the number of times the player has had the opportunity to bat during matches. It reflects how frequently the player has been part of the batting lineup.

6. Not Out: This feature records the number of times the player remained not out during their batting innings. A "not out" means that the player did not get dismissed and was still at the crease when the team's innings concluded.

7. Runs Scored: This column represents the total number of runs the player has scored with the bat during the matches played. It is a fundamental measure of a player's batting performance.

8. Highest Score: This feature shows the highest number of runs the player scored in a single inning during the specified period. It indicates the player's best individual batting performance.

9. Batting Average: Batting average is a statistical measure that indicates a player's average runs per dismissal. It is calculated as "Runs Scored / (Batting Innings - Not Out)." A higher batting average generally indicates better consistency.

10. Balls Faced: This column records the total number of balls faced by the player while batting. It shows how many deliveries the player has encountered in their innings.

11. Batting Strike Rate: Batting strike rate is a measure of how quickly a player scores runs. It is calculated as "(Runs Scored / Balls Faced) * 100." A higher strike rate suggests an aggressive batting style.

12. Bowling Economy Rate: Although not explicitly mentioned in your dataset, it appears to be a feature that might indicate the economy rate of the player while bowling. Bowling economy rate represents the average number of runs conceded by the bowler per over bowled. It is calculated as "Runs Conceded / Overs Bowled."

These features collectively provide insights into a cricket player's performance during the specified team, including their batting and, potentially, bowling performance, as well as their participation in the tournament. Analysis of these features can help in evaluating and comparing players' contributions to their teams.
